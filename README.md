# Sherlock Holmes RNN
In this project, I build an Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architecture in Keras that generates semi-coherent English sentences from scratch by building them up character-by-character.  For the training set, I will be using a complete version of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's classic book The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes.
